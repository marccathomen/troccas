# Troccas Rules used in the project

## Definition of the cards
---

The game consists of 78 cards. The following list of the cards is sorted by the card strength.

### Card Types and Suits
* r = Rosas - (Roses suit)
* c = Cups - (Cups suit)
* s = Spadas - (Swords suit)
* b = Bastuns - (Bats suit
* t = Troccas
* n = Narr - Joker

The 4 suits (r,c,s,b) have each 14 cards, numbered from 1 to 10 and the 4 Figuras (Face Cards): Buob (Jack), Cavalier (Knight), Femna (Queen), Retg (King).
These cards are comparable with a [Standard 52 Card Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck), but with some exceptions:
* There is an extra card: the Cavalier (Knight), making a total of 14 cards for each suit.
* The strength of the cards is different then in a standard 52 deck game like eg. [Texas Hold'em Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) (more about this below)

The Troccas are numbered from 1 to 21

The Narr (Joker) has no number

### Beating strength and card value
Note: the beating power and the card value are very different. A high strenght card like t20 beats the retg da rosas but it has a value of 0 while the retg has a value of 5

#### Beating strength
* Troccas: The troccas cards always beat the suit cards while the higher numbered troccas beats the lower troccas card. t21 (il mund/ the world) is the strongest card in the game
*  Face Cards: The face cards of each suit beat the numbered cards of the same suit (and *only* the same suit) while the retg (king) ist stronger then the femna (queen), the femna is stronger then the cavalier (knight), the cavalier is stronger then the buob (Jack) 
* Numbered spadas (swords) and bastuns (bats): The 10 beats the 9, the 9 beats the 8, ... down to the one
* Numbered rosas (roses) and cups (cups): The 1 beats the 2, the 2 beats the 3, ... up to the 10 
* Narr (joker): The Narr has no beating strength and loses always

#### Card values
* Troccas: t21 (il mund) and t1 (il bagat) have a value of 5 points each. All other troccas have a value of 0 points
* Ils retgs (kings): the 4 retgs have each a value of 5 points  
* Las femnas (queens): the 4 femnas have each a value of 4 points
* Ils cavaliers (knights): the 4 cavaliers have each a value of 3 points

## Players and the environment
---
* Troccas is usually played by 4 players. There are other rules of another number of players. For this project we use the 4 players rules of Crusch Alva, Tavanasa (restaurant in a village in Surselva).
* The 4 players sit on each side of a table in a way that the are able to hide the cards from the other players.
* The players that sit diagonally build a team
* To play the game they use one deck of cards, a card game carpet, a piece of paper and a ruler


## Phases of the game
---
The game has the following phases. In each phase there are decisions to be made
* P1 Team building and select starting Player 
* P2 Shuffling
* P3 Distribution, Tschintschar (Announcing the hand to the partner),  deciding whether to play or starting over with shuffling
* P4 Play the hands
* P5 Counting the played game
P2 to P5 are repeated 4 times while changing the starting player clockwise for each game = ina runda (one round)

A predefined number of rounds will be played in a tournament. This number can vary from event to event.
* P6 Replay for n rounds
* P7 Defining the winner of the n rounds game
