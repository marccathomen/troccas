# Troccas Rules used in the project

## Definition of the cards
---

The game consists of 78 cards. The following list of the cards is sorted by the card strength.

### Card Types and Suits
* r = Rosas - (Roses suit)
* c = Cups - (Cups suit)
* s = Spadas - (Swords suit)
* b = Bastuns - (Bats suit
* t = Troccas
* n = Narr - Joker

The 4 suits (r,c,s,b) have each 13 cards, numbered from 1 to 10 and the 4 Figuras (Face Cards): Buob (Jack), Cavalier (Knight), Femna (Queen), Retg (King).
These cards are comparable with a [Standard 52 Card Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck), but with some exceptions:
* There is an extra card: the Cavalier (Knight), making a total of 14 cards for each suit.
* The strength of the cards is different then in a standard 52 deck game like eg. [Texas Hold'em Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) (more about this below)

The Troccas are numbered from 1 to 21

The Narr (Joker) has no number

### Beating strength and card value
Note: the beating power and the card value are very different. A high strenght card like t20 beats the retg da rosas but it has a value of 0 while the retg has a value of 5

#### Beating strength
* Troccas: The troccas cards always beat the suit cards while the higher numbered troccas beats the lower troccas card. t21 (il mund/ the world) is the strongest card in the game
*  Face Cards: The face cards of each suit beat the numbered cards of the same suit (and *only* the same suit) while the retg (king) ist stronger then the femna (queen), the femna is stronger then the cavalier (knight), the cavalier is stronger then the buob (Jack) 
* Numbered spadas (swords) and bastuns (bats): The 10 beats the 9, the 9 beats the 8, ... down to the one
* Numbered rosas (roses) and cups (cups): The 1 beats the 2, the 2 beats the 3, ... up to the 10 
* Narr (joker): The Narr has no beating strength and loses always
